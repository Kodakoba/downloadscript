# downloadscript
A powershell script template built to handle your downloading needs from commandline (with progress!)

How to use:
open in Powershell ISE or with notepad/notepad++ or Visual Studio, 
edit the last lines to fit your needs, here's an example:

**downloadFile "https://icatcare.org/app/uploads/2018/06/Layer-1704-1920x840.jpg" "D:catpic.jpg"**

It's supposed to be easy and neat, and can be chained! I also think you can include the function definition in other files.
